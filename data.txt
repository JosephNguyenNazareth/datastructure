Comparision between Struct and Class in C++
Similarity:
- Concept: Define new data type, or new group of variable.
- Coding: Access through a dot (.) (with object type) or an right arrow(->) (with pointer type).
- Method: Internal function.
- Constructor: Special method, initialise member.
- Inherited: easily single inheritance, multiple inheritance ("virtual").
- Type name: Create new data type, can be used in programme.
- Pointer initialise: both can be used with "new".
- Friendship: External function can access to struct or class that declared "friend".
Difference:
Struct:
- Accessibility: members are default public.
Class:
- Accessibility: members are default private.
